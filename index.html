              <p>When we started in 2014, the goal was to solve a particular problem we had: make sure our extra seats at Nashville Predators games never went empty. More than 150 people from all over the country used (or at least tried) SeatShare, and we're pretty proud of that.</p>
              <p>SeatShare lives on as an <a href="https://github.com/seatshare">open source project</a>, which means anyone can take the code we wrote and run their own private season ticket group. We hope you found it useful and thank you for giving us a try.</p>
